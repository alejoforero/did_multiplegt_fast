# did_multiplegt_fast
Parallel version of did_multiplegt. Parallelizes the bootstrap calculation, everything else is the same and credit goes to the creators of the original command.

Using Stata MP4 and a 16 core CPU I achieved estimation time reduction of up to 90%.

Set maxprocessors(#) to a number close to the cores of your computer such that it minimizes mod(breps,#). For example if you set breps to 50 and have a 16 core processor, the most efficient parameter is either 13 or 17. Your mileage may vary.
Also note that this will open # Stata sessions each with a copy of your data. Make sure you have enough RAM memory for that, and if not, minimize the estimation dataset with only the needed variables.


# Requirements
`ssc install matsave`

Install `ftools` and from github, not SSC

```
cap ado uninstall ftools

net install ftools, from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sergiocorreia/ftools/master/src/")
```
Check his website for more details on installation.

Install `parallel` from github; don't install from SSC:
```
cap ado uninstall parallel

net install parallel, from(https://raw.github.com/gvegayon/parallel/stable/) replace

mata mata mlib index
```

# Installation

`net install did_multiplegt_fast, from("https://raw.github.com/alejoforero/did_multiplegt_fast/master/")`

# Validation
You can compare the results of the fast versus the original command with the dofile: `did_multiplegt_fast_validation.do`. Once the seed is set, the results are identical.
