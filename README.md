Install `ftools` and from github, not SSC

```
cap ado uninstall ftools

net install ftools, from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sergiocorreia/ftools/master/src/")
```

net install parallel, from(https://raw.github.com/gvegayon/parallel/stable/) replace

mata mata mlib index
```

# Installation

`net install did_multiplegt_fast, from("https://raw.github.com/alejoforero/did_multiplegt_fast/master/")`

# Validation
You can compare the results of the fast versus the original command with the dofile: `did_multiplegt_fast_validation.do`. Once the seed is set, the results are identical.
